## Features Overview
This is a full package for 2D
XRD data. Besides general processing tools, it includes specific data analysis routines for the
application of the automated phase identification. This software allows the creation of a user compound database for the identification of crystalline
phases.

The program has been developed prioritizing the ease-of-use and the
visualization of the diffraction data. It is composed of a main window (see below) that displays
the loaded XRD data and provides access to all the display-related options and to all the processing
and analysis operations from a top menu. The XRD data can be navigated using the mouse and live information of the region under the cursor is
displayed.
